abstract = {Between January 2001 and May 2003, 167 stream segments on the islands of Kaua'i, O'ahu, Maui, and Hawai'i were sampled for stream macroalgae and measured for a series of physical and chemical conditions. Conditions ranged more widely than previously reported, which is likely due to the greater diversity of habitats accessed and the year-round sampling representation in this study. Water temperature ranged from 12.5 to 27.5 °C (mean = 21.4 °C ± 2.4), pH from 5.5 to 8.9 (mean = 7.8 ± 0.5), and specific conductance from 20 to 490 $\mu$S{\textperiodcentered}cm-1 (mean - 102 $\mu$S{\textperiodcentered}cm-1 ± 75.9). A total of 160 specific and subspecific taxa was identified, of which 27 are new records for the Hawaiian Archipelago. The Chlorophyta compose the majority of the taxa, followed by the Cyanobacteria, Rhodophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Tribophyta. The mean number of taxa per stream segment was 5.0 ± 2.7, which is the highest such value reported. Grouping of taxa by morphological form demonstrates that the majority of taxa were free filaments (58%), followed by mats (17%), tufts (13%), and gelatinous colonies (9%). A principal coordinates analysis of the stream sites indicated that a high degree of overlap in floristic composition is evident for most of the Islands, and only sites on the island of Hawai'i exhibit a localized positioning to one side of the principal coordinates bi-plot. The flora of Hawai'i Island appears to be unique only in the sense that it contains fewer broadly distributed taxa than the remaining islands, which may be a function of island age. Cluster analysis of the islands based on two types of comparisons suggests stronger similarities between the islands of Maui and Kaua'i, and O'ahu and Hawai'i than previously reported. The Hawaiian stream macroalgal flora contains a number of cosmopolitan taxa, although it is recognized that concepts of some of these taxa may change with additional data. {\textcopyright} 2006 by University of Hawai'i Press All rights reserved.},

@article{cheroske2000effects,
abstract = {Disturbance in coral real environments commonly results in an algal community dominated by highly productive, small filamentous forms and cyanobacteria, collectively known as algal turf. Research on the types of disturbance responsible for this community structure has concentrated mainly on biological disturbance in the form of grazing, although physical and other forms of biological disturbances may be important in many coral reef areas. On the reef that in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, algal turfs grow primarily upon coral rubble that tumbles with passing swells. We manipulated the frequency of rubble tumbling in field experiments to mimic the effects of physical disturbance by abrasion and light reduction on algal biomass, canopy height, and community structure. Treatments approximated a gradient of disturbance intensities and durations that occur on the reef flat. Although sea urchins and herbivorous fishes are not widespread and abundant on the reef flat, biological disturbances to algal turf communities in the form of herbivory by small crabs and abrasion by tough macroalgae contributed significantly to the variation in algal turf biomass. Within all experiments increasing disturbances significantly reduced algal biomass and canopy heights and the community structure shifted to more disturbance-tolerant algal forms. This shows that the chronic physical disturbances from water motion and biological disturbances other than grazing from large herbivores can control algal communities in coral reef environments.

abstract = {This chapter summarizes fieldwork conducted to derive new estimates of coastal groundwater discharge and associated nutrient loadings at select coastal sites in Hawai'i, USA. Locations for this work were typically identified based on pronounced, recent ecosystem degradation that may at least partially be attributable to sustained coastal groundwater discharge. Our suite of tools used to evaluate groundwater discharge included select U/Th series radionuclides, a broad spectrum of geochemical analytes, multi-channel electrical resistivity, and in situ oceanographic observations. Based on the submarine groundwater discharge tracer 222Rn, coastal groundwater discharge rates ranged from about 22–50 cm per day at Kahekili, a site in the Ka'anapali region north of Lahaina in west Maui, while at Black Point in Maunalua Bay along southern O'ahu, coastal groundwater discharge rates ranged up to 700 cm per day, although the mean discharge rate at this site was 60 cm per day. The water chemistry of the discharging groundwater can be dramatically different than ambient seawater at both coastal sites. For example, at Kahekili the average concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved silicate (DSi) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) were roughly 188-, 36-, and 106-times higher in the discharging groundwater relative to ambient seawater, respectively. Such data extend our basic understanding of the physical controls on coastal groundwater discharge and provide an estimate of the magnitude and physical forcings of submarine groundwater discharge and associated trace metal and nutrient loads conveyed by this submarine route.},

abstract = {Municipal wastewater plumes discharging from aquifer to ocean were detected by nearshore wading surveys at Kihei and Lahaina, on the island of Maui in Hawaii. Developed in cooperation with the Hawaii State Department of Health, the survey methodology included instrument trolling to detect submarine groundwater discharge, followed by analysis of water and macroalgae for a suite of chemical and isotopic constituents that constitute a “multitracer” approach. Surveys were conducted May 6–28, 2008, during fair-weather conditions and included: (1) wading and kayak trolling with a multiparameter water-quality sonde, (2) marine water-column sampling, and (3) collection of benthic algae samples. Instrument trolling helped guide the water sampling strategy by providing dense, continuous transects of water properties on which groundwater discharge zones could be identified. Water and algae samples for costly chemical and isotopic laboratory analyses were last to be collected but were highly diagnostic of wastewater presence and nutrient origin because of low detection levels and confirmation across multiple tracers. Laboratory results confirmed the presence of wastewater constituents in marine water-column samples at both locales and showed evidence of modifying processes such as denitrification and mixing of effluent with surrounding groundwater and seawater. Carbamazepine was the most diagnostic pharmaceutical, detected in several marine water-column samples and effluent at both Kihei and Lahaina. Heavy nitrogen-isotope compositions in water and algae were highly diagnostic of effluent, particularly where enriched to even heavier values than effluent source compositions by denitrification. Algae provided an added advantage of time-integrating their nitrogen source during growth. The measured Kihei plume coincided almost exactly with prior model predictions, but the Lahaina plume was detected well south of the expected direct path from injection wells to shore and may be guided by a buried valley fill from an ancestral course of Honokowai Stream. Nutrient concentrations in upland wells at Lahaina were comparable to concentrations in wastewater but originate instead from agricultural fertilizers. A key factor in detecting and mapping the wastewater plumes was sampling very close to shore (mostly within 20 m or so) and in very shallow water (mostly 0.5 to 2 m depth). Effluent probably discharges somewhat offshore as well, although prior attempts to detect an injected fluorescent tracer at Lahaina in the 1990s were inconclusive, having focused farther offshore in water mostly 10–30 m deep. Sampling of benthic porewater and algae would offer the best chances for further effluent detection and mapping offshore, and sampling of onland monitor wells could provide additional understanding of geochemical processes that take place in the effluent plumes and bring about some degree of natural attenuation of nutrients.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to assess the contamination of Honolua Bay using an ecotoxicological approach. First, the concentrations of 9 contaminants (metals and metalloid) were assessed in sediments and tropical marine organisms (alga Halimeda kanaloana, goatfish Parupeneus multifasciatus and urchin Tripneustes gratilla) sampled from Honolua and surrounding Bays. Then, the ecological parameters characterizing coral health (e.g. coral cover) were evaluated in Honolua Bay in the context of these contaminants. High concentrations of Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, and V in sediments from Honolua and Honokohau Bay were measured, but these concentrations were not mirrored in the organisms examined, except for Mn, suggesting that the metals are generally bound in chemically inert forms in these sediments. Moreover, few anthropogenic activities impact these bays and so the elevated Co, Cr, Mn, Ni and V concentrations in sediments appear to stem from their high natural background in Honolua and Honokohau watersheds. An analysis of the relationship between the ecological parameters and metal concentrations in Honolua Bay revealed a significant correlation between coral cover and Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, V, Zn concentrations in sediments, with coral cover decreasing with increasing metal concentration. Collectively, however, the data suggest that a complex mixture of land-based stressors (e.g. sediment, metals, nutrients) affect the coral health in Honolua Bay, rather than metal stress alone. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Craggs1996a,
abstract = {Algal turf scrubbing is a novel technology for the treatment of agricultural runoff and eutrophic lake water and may have application for wastewater treatment. The algal turf scrubber (ATS)\textregistered consists of a natural, mixed assemblage of attached periphyton, microalgae and bacteria which colonise an inclined floway over which wastewater flows in a series of pulses. A large-scale ATS (152.4 m long 6.5 m wide) was constructed in Patterson, California and tested in conjunction with UV disinfection over one year for its ability to treat secondary effluent from an evaporation pond. The hydraulic loading rate of the wastewater was varied between 436 and 1226 m$^3$ per day and various operational parameters were tested. The biomass was mechanically harvested from the noway at one or two week intervals depending upon the season. This paper will present the results for phosphorus removal and productivity of the algal turf Phosphorus removal from the secondary wastewater was measured twice a week during four, 8 week quarters corresponding to the solar seasons. The phosphorus content of the harvested solids was also measured during these periods. Based on the mean percentage of P (2.1%) in the harvested solids and the mean productivity (35 g m$^{-2}$ d$^{-1}$), the yearly mean removal of phosphorus was 0.73 ± 0.28 g m$^{-2}$ d$^{-1}$. An inverse relationship was found between reduction in hydraulic loading rate and increase in pH, phosphorus removal and hardness reduction by the ATS. This indicated that pH mediated precipitation probably accounts for much of the phosphorus removal by the ATS and for the high mean phosphorus content of the harvested solids. Measurement of nutrient concentrations in influent and effluent of the ATS over 24 hours showed that at night phosphorus removal declined. These results indicate the potential of the ATS for phosphorus removal from wastewaters and suggest that removal may be easily controlled by altering the hydraulic loading rate.},
