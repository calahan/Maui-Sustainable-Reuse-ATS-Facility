Here we describe a pilot facility, dubbed the Maui Sustainable Reuse Pilot (MSRP), being developed to demonstrate cost-effective ecologically engineered recycling of nutrient pollution from R-1 water into agriculture. The nutrient recycling component of MSRP works by facilitating the proliferation of native filamentous algae, whose rapid growth efficiently removes the unwanted nitrogen species (N), and additionally phosphate (P) and other substances, from the influent R-1 water. Frequent harvest permanently removes nutrient pollution from the system. The biomass is applied (either directly or after composting) as a slow-release fertilizer/soil amendment to nourish the Reuse Forest, which itself is irrigated using the polished water. The MSRP is funded and as of this writing has received preliminary approval from Maui County and awaits final approval from the Hawaii Department of Health.
