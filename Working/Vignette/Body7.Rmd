\centerline{Additional Information}
The Reuse Forest will demonstrate a circular agricultural nutrient economy utilizing algae-scrubbed R-1 water and algal biomass and as the sole irrigation and soil nourishing components. While N removal is the primary polishing goal, high P removal is also potentially available, as the consumption of CO~2~ and HCO~3~ drive a high pH and consequent chemical precipitation of P salts. This situation leads to carbon limitation and lower growth rates such that biomass production and therefore N removal may be lower than desired. If additional funding can be secured, we will augment the facility with CO~2~ injection technology to manipulate carbon availability and therefore growth rate and N removal in an effort to put the nutrient removal ratio under positive control.
