\centerline{Reuse Forest}
The Reuse Forest will demonstrate utilization of both the polished water and the algal biomass byproduct. A collection of native plant mesocosms will be established prior to constructing the algal floway, initially irrigated with unpolished R-1 water and with no additional fertilization beyond the original soil installation. Once the floway is operational, irrigation will be provided using the polished water and the harvested algal biomass will be applied as a fertilizer/soil amendment, either directly or after composting.
