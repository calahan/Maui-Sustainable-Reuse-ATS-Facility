Algal growth can consume dissolved CO~2~ faster than atmospheric transport replaces it, increasing the water's pH as the water progresses along the floway -- essentially the opposite of ocean acidification. Without CO~2~ supplementation, a recirculating system becomes increasingly alkaline and carbon limited. A favorable outcome of the high pH is that phosphate salts precipitate chemically within the biomass\hspace{-3pt}@van2004ecological@Craggs1996a, leading to a substantially higher P content in the harvested biomass compared to typical ratios. Thus, even though N is the major target for this project, total P can potentially also be reduced to very low concentrations. Figure 2 depicts potential biomass production and nutrient removal according to two possible pilot operating schemes (Figs. 2A, 2B).
