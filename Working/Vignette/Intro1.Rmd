The Ma’alaea Regional Wastewater Reclamation System (MRWRS) project is being developed with the aim of improving the ecological health of Maui’s Maa'lea Bay (“the Bay”). By utilizing advanced wastewater treatment, effluent that currently degrades the Bay's ecological health due to excess total nitrogen (TN) will instead be additionally cleaned (e.g. from ~10 to ~5 mg L-1 TN) and used to irrigate/fertilize ten acres of constructed grassland. To demonstrate additional polishing, a  portion of the treated water will be utilized to cultivate native algae (limu) using a technique known as algal turf scrubbing (ATS). ATS has the potential of substantially further reducing pollutant concentration while producing biomass that can be harvested and either composted or used directly as a slow release fertilizer.
