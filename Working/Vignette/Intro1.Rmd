The ecological health of Maui’s Maalea Bay (“the Bay”) is impaired by excess nitrogen (as nitrate/nitrite and ammonia) leading to unwanted seaweed and algal blooms and turbidity, bacteria such as _Enterococcus_ fecal indicators, and other microbes. These pollutants degrade recreational activities such as boating, diving, fishing, swimming, snorkeling and surfing, imposing substantial opportunity costs on the local tourism industry\hspace{-3pt}@van2004ecological. A major source of these pollutants is the Kihei Wastewater Reclamation Facility (WWRF). The WWRF discharges ~`r FormatFlow(site_def$inj_flow, 1)` of bacterially contaminated, nutrient-rich secondary municipal wastewater (R-2 water) into injection wells, with an additional ~`r FormatFlow(site_def$add_flow, 1)` of this water, decontaminated with ultraviolet light (R-1 water), distributed through infrastructure known as the R-1 Network, used for landscape irrigation. Current wastewater disposal practices have been found in violation\hspace{-3pt}@US2020, leading to initiation of a $9.5 million project to construct the Maalaea Regional Wastewater Reclamation System.
