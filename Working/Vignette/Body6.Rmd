Findings from this pilot will inform the design for the 0.3 acre demonstration algal polishing system planned for the MRWRS. The R-1 output from the enhanced treatment system, projected to range from 5-8 mg L^-1^ total N, will be polished to substantially lower nutrient concentrations. Specific operational features of the pilot will be determined over a range of conditions for one or more complete years of operation. These features include: 1) TN and TP removal rates, 2) biomass productivity and composition, 3) effectiveness of treated water for irrigation and algal biomass as fertilizer/soil amendment, and 4) responsiveness to operational and environmental changes. Features one and two relate to the algal growth area needed to ensure a minimum nutrient removal rate, feature 3 relates to management of the treated wastewater and the algal biomass product, and feature 4 relates to design elements affording the potential to maximize polishing effectiveness. Figure 2C illustrates potential tradeoffs between treatment level and floway size.
