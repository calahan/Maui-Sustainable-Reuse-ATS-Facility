This vignette compares the design and operation of the algal floway pilot and production facilities for the Maui Sustainable Reuse Project (MSRP). The pilot facility will demonstrate algal floway farming procedures such as cultivation, harvesting, biomass processing and influent/effluent management and utilization. The information provided by the pilot facility will inform the design and operation of the production floway planned as a component of the MSRP.
