This vignette describes a pilot wastewater polishing facility to be installed at Haleakala Ranch, Kihei, Maui, Hawaii. This pilot will demonstrate algae farming as a biological approach to reducing nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in secondary municipal wastewater. The polished water and resultant algal biomass will be used to irrigate and fertilize a collection of native plant mesocosms (the Reuse Forest). Findings from this study will inform the design and operation of an algal water polishing demonstration at the planned Ma'alaea Regional Wastewater Reclamation System.
