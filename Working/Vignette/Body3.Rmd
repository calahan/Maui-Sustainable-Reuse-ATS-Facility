An algal floway self-inoculates. Algae cells are ubiquitous, conveyed into the floway as aquatic aerosols or airborne particles with adherent algal cells, or by migrating animals. Anyone familiar with open water bodies knows how hard it is to suppress algal growth. Facilitating its proliferation instead is a matter of providing the appropriate environment. For an algal floway, a high-surface-area substratum submerged under several inches of irregularly flowing water provides this environment, essentially an artificial stream. Algal cells adhere to the substratum and develop into a canopy of attached filaments, removing nutrients from the water as it flows through. A single pass along a several-hundred-foot floway long can remove a few percent of the N and P originally present. Recirculating the water for multiple passes removes additional increments.
